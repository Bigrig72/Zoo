# Zoo

## Building A Zoo with classes and interfaces
This is a Fantasy creature Zoo Showing the implementation of the OOP principles using classes and Interfaces.

## Define the OOP principles and how these classes are implemented
Abstract classes are defined from the top and works its way down to the more specific concrete classes. Interfaces are used in order to include multiple behavior across the classes. Find below a map for demonstration

1. Use of Abstract classes -- Through the process of abstraction, I hide all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

2. Use of Inheritence -- Having ability for one object to take on the states, behaviors, and functionality of another object. 

3. Polymorphism- Describes the concept that different classes can be used with the same interface

## Describe what your interfaces are, where are they being implemented
Im using IFLY and ISWIM as my two interface, you will find below in the diagram how I am implemnting them. I am using Wingspan and Flightspeed for my IFly interface, which is used for one concrete class Hippogriff and one abstract class called fantasy fliers. ISwim is being used for Hippogriff and Fantasy Swimmers, which is also abstract.

## Updated diagram with your classes and interfaces mapped out.

## Testing
Unit test were done to ---
Prove that the classes that implement the interface actually implement it
Prove inheritance
Prove Polymorphism
Prove methods have been overridden
Prove that one of your concrete animals is an Animal
