# Zoo

## Building A Zoo with classes and interfaces
This is a Fantasy creature Zoo Showing the implementation of the OOP principles using classes and Interfaces.

## Define what an interface is in your own words
An interface is something I would use in order to include multiple behavior across classes.
## Describe what your interfaces are, where are they being implemented, and why. Provide Examples.
Im using IFLY and ISWIM as my two interface, you will find below in the diagram how I am implemnting them. I am using Wingspan and Flightspeed for my IFly interface, which is used for one concrete class Hippogriff and one abstract class called fantasy fliers. ISwim is being used for Hippogriff and Fantasy Swimmers, which is also abstract.

## Updated diagram with your interfaces mapped out.
